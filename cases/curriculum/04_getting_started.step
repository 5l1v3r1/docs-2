  note <<-MARKDOWN
  You can see that <code>rails new</code> created a lot directories and
  files. The ones we want to focus on today are:
  MARKDOWN

  table :border=>"1", :cellspacing=>"0", :cellpadding=>"3", :align=>"center" do
    tr {
      th " File/Folder"
      th " Purpose"
    }
    tr {
      td " app/"
      td " Contains the controllers, models, and views for your application.  You will do most of your work here."
    }
    tr {
      td " config/"
      td " Configure your applicationâ€™s runtime rules, routes, database, and more."
    }
    tr {
      td " db/"
      td " Shows your current database schema, as well as the database migrations."
    }
    tr {
      td " public/"
      td " The only folder seen to the world as-is.  This is where your images, JavaScript,  stylesheets (CSS), and other static files go"
    }
  end

  note "There is a lot more that `rails new` created. Probably enough to fill a book, so we're going to ignore them for now."
