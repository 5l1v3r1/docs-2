==Getting Started==
Find your operating system in the list below, or the operating system closest to what you have. Follow the step-by-step instructions. If you get stuck or hit a problem you can't figure out - no worries. Once you get to the installfest, volunteers will help you pick up where you left off.

'''Even if you get stuck, please go through the rest of the instructions and download all the things you'll need.''' Bandwidth will be at a premium during the installfest, so it will help immensely to have everything on your laptop already.

There are a lot of steps, and the instructions may seem like they're in a foreign language, but: '''don't panic!''' By the end of the workshop, you'll know what each one is and how to use it.

==What to Bring to the Event==
'''For sure'''

* '''Your laptop.''' If you have a choice between a Mac and a Windows laptop, please bring the Mac.
* '''Power cord for your laptop'''
* Mac users: Bring along your '''OS X DVD''', if you can, for the Xcode install (see below)


'''Possibly also helpful'''

* Extension cord/power strip - sometimes there are not enough of these
* Camera
