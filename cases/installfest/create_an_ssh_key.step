    note "`id_rsa.pub` is your **public key** and can be shared freely."
    note "`id_rsa` is your **private key** and must be kept secret."
    note "If someone else gets your private key and your passphrase, then they can pretend to be you and log on to your Heroku or Github accounts and cause mischief!"
