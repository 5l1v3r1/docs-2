* If you already have Firefox installed, verify that it is **version 3.6.13** or greater. (Help -&gt; About Mozilla Firefox. The version number is right under the &quot;Firefox&quot; title.)

* If you don't have Firefox installed, or it's an older version, [<http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/> install Firefox].

* Once it's installed, open Firefox and go to Tools -&gt; Add-ons. At the top of the add-ons window, click &quot;Get Add-ons.&quot;

* There will be search box directly underneath &quot;Get Add-ons&quot; that says &quot;Search All Add-ons.&quot; Enter &quot;SQLite&quot; (without the quotes) in the box and hit enter.

* **SQLite Manager** should be the top result. Click &quot;Add to Firefox...&quot; (If SQLite Manager isn't in the results, check the spelling - SQLite only has one L. Also, check that you have at least Firefox 3.5.)

* Wait for the countdown, then click &quot;Install Now.&quot;

* In the Add-ons windows, click &quot;Restart Firefox.&quot;

* Once Firefox restarts, the Add-ons window should say &quot;1 new add-on has been installed.&quot;
