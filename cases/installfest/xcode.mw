The Xcode tools are too large to download at the installfest. '''Please try to download them before you come.''' We'll have some versions of Xcode on thumb drives at the event, but we may not have the specific version you need.

You need to know which version of OS X you are running. The choices are Snow Leopard (the most recent), Leopard, Tiger, or Panther. ([[Determining_your_OS_X_version|Not sure which version of OS X you have?]])
Once you have the Xcode file on your desktop, double-click to open it like a DVD, and then follow the rest of the DVD installation instructions.

'''Steps to download Xcode for Macs running Snow Leopard:'''
* Go to the [http://developer.apple.com/technology/xcode.html main Xcode download page]. Click on the "Mac Dev Center" in the lower right.
* Sign in with your Apple Developer Connection (ADC) account. If you have another account with Apple, you can use that. Otherwise, click on "sign up" in the text at the bottom to create an account. After you create an account, you may need to navigate back to [http://developer.apple.com/technology/xcode.html the Xcode download page].
* Once you've logged in, download the Xcode 3.2 (Disk Image).
