**Special note for folks who upgraded from Leopard to Snow Leopard:** The SQLite gem does not compile with an older version of Xcode installed. If you upgraded your machine from an older version of OS X, and you have an older Xcode, you still need to reinstall it from your **Snow Leopard** DVD. The steps below should work fine to upgrade it.

  You won't be using the test application in the workshop; we just created it to make sure everything was working. You should delete it now to reduce confusion during the workshop. Don't worry about losing information - you'll repeat all the steps tomorrow, but more slowly so you can better understand what's going on under the hood.
