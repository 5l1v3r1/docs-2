We'll be using the KomodoEdit text editor during the workshop, though you are free to use a different editor if you prefer. It must be a plain-text editor, such as vi or Textmate. Microsoft Word and other word processing programs won't work. If in doubt, use KomodoEdit.

  note <<-MARKDOWN

You won't be using the test application in the workshop; we just created it to make sure everything was working. You should delete it now to reduce confusion during the workshop. Don't worry about losing information - you'll repeat all the steps tomorrow, but more slowly so you can better understand what's going on under the hood.


* Drag the test_app folder (inside ruby_on_rails) to the trash. Leave ruby_on_rails on the desktop.

* Delete the app from Heroku. Go to <https://heroku.com/myapps> and then click on your app name. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Destroy App.
