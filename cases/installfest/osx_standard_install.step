step "open Terminal" do
  note "Look for **Terminal.app** inside Applications -> Utilities."

step "Install Git" do

step "Install KomodoEdit " do
  note <<-MARKDOWN

We'll be using the KomodoEdit text editor during the workshop, though you are free to use a different editor if you prefer. It must be a plain-text editor, such as vi or Textmate. Microsoft Word and other word processing programs won't work. If in doubt, use KomodoEdit.

step "Other required libraries " do

* Open a Terminal window and type the following with a return at the end of each line:
   gem install rspec rspec-rails cucumber cucumber-rails database_cleaner webrat heroku --no-rdoc --no-ri

step "Verify successful installation " do
  note <<-MARKDOWN

In this step, we make sure the installation script actually installed everything correctly.

**Steps to verify installation:**


* In a Terminal window, type the following, followed by return:
    which git
It should say:
    /usr/local/bin/git

* In a Terminal window, type the following, followed by return:
    which ruby
It should say:
    /usr/local/bin/ruby

* In a Terminal window, type the following, followed by return:
    which rails
It should say:
    /usr/local/bin/rails

* In a Terminal window, type the following, followed by return:
    gem list --local
It should say:
    *** LOCAL GEMS ***

**Finally**, make sure you can do everything in the following sections of the [<http://wiki.devchix.com/index.php?title=Server_2003> Windows install directions] (from "Create a Test Application" onwards). Wherever it says "git bash", you can mentally substitute "Terminal" - git bash is the name for the Terminal-equivalent program on Windows. I know, strange name!

step "Congratulations! " do
  note <<-MARKDOWN

You have everything you need to write a Ruby on Rails application.

  MARKDOWN
  end

step "Cleanup " do
  note <<-MARKDOWN

You won't be using the test application in the workshop; we just created it to make sure everything was working. You should delete it now to reduce confusion during the workshop. Don't worry about losing information - you'll repeat all the steps tomorrow, but more slowly so you can better understand what's going on under the hood.


* Drag the test_app folder (inside ruby_on_rails) to the trash. Leave ruby_on_rails on the desktop.

* Delete the app from Heroku. Go to <https://heroku.com/myapps> and then click on your app name. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Destroy App.
