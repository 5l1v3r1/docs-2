* Rails will be installed in C:\\RailsInstaller and the directory for your Rails projects will be C:\\Sites

* From the Windows Start menu, go to Programs, RailsInstaller, Console with Ruby and Rails

* The first time you run this program, it will ask you to enter your name and email address. After doing this, test your Ruby install in the terminal using the -v version flag
<pre>
ruby -v
</pre>
You should see something like
<pre>
ruby 1.9.2p290 (2011-07-09) [i386-mingw32]
</pre>


* Test your Rails install in the terminal using the -v version flag
<pre>
rails -v
</pre>
You should see something like
<pre>
Rails 3.1.0
</pre>

step "Open a Terminal " do
  note <<-MARKDOWN

* Much of  using Rails is typing commands and hitting **&lt;enter&gt;**.  Your experience using Rails on Windows greatly depends on your making friends with the terminal window.  Normally you will work in a terminal window and keep it open along with your browser.

* This is also called the terminal, command window, command-line window, MS-DOS or DOS window. Follow these instructions if you need to open a normal DOS window:
[Opening a terminal window](windows_terminal)

* Rails Installer made a special DOS terminal window for you to use when you're working on Ruby, Rails, or Git.  To open the special Rails window, choose "Programs" on the Start menu, then choose "RailsInstaller" and then "Console with Ruby and Rails".  You should do all your Rails work in this RailsInstaller DOS window.

  tip "clearing the terminal" do
    note "If you ever want to clear the terminal of all its cluttered output"
    console "cls"

  tip "command history" do
   note "The terminal window stores a \"command history.\" To view and re-run previous commands, use the &lt;up arrow&gt; and &lt;down arrow&gt; keys.  You can also edit a previous command and run it -- this is handy for long commands, or fixing mistakes."
 end

 tip "copy and paste" do

step "Install KomodoEdit " do
  note <<-MARKDOWN

You need a text editor to do Ruby. If you already have a preferred text editor, such as vi, emacs, jedit, etc., you can skip this step. It must be a plain text editor and not something with styling like Microsoft Word or WordPad.  

Notepad is not a good programming editor, but it will work in a pinch.

**When in doubt, use KomodoEdit.**

* [<http://downloads.activestate.com/Komodo/releases/6.1.1/Komodo-Edit-6.1.1-7295.msi> Download KomodoEdit here].

* Double-click to install.
