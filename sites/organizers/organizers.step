### Organizers are super

RailsBridge Workshops don't happen without organizers. The role of the organizers fall into roughly three buckets:

* pre-workshop logistics planning
* day-of logistics, mostly pointing.
* presenting and talking

It's easier to cover all the bases if you have at least two organizers for each workshop.

### Hosts are super, too!
