## What is HTML?

HTML stands for __H__yper-__t__ext __M__arkup __L__anguage.

Let's go through each of those words in reverse order and explain them...

* __L__anguage - People use different languages for different types of communication.
  We use languages such as English or Mandarin for human communication or languages such as
  Ruby or Java to give instructions to computers.  HTML is a special language for describing documents.

* __M__arkup - Being a *markup* language means that HTML is mixed in with plain content text.
  Think of a time when you turned in an essay to your teacher.  Your teacher reads your essay
  and *marks* it *up* with comments or suggestions, adding extra information on top of the plain text
  content.

- __H__yper-__t__ext - This term comes from the fact that early computers could only work with plain text
  files.  Computer users as early as the 1960s wanted to enrich this text and make it easier to work with.
  Thus, hypertext was born.  It is text because the file is stored as plain text, yet hyper because the text
  has a special meaning beyond the plain text when interpreted by a special program.  For HTML, that special
  program is your web browser.

You'll need to fire up your text editor (like Sublime Text, Komodo Edit, or Text Wrangler) for these steps. We're going to make an html document!

Make a new file and call it <b>hello.html</b>. (In some editors, you may need to set the file type to 'HTML'; but usually, just using the .html extension will be enough.)

<img src='img/hello_html.png'>

Notice the extension .html.  It indicates to the browser that it should render this content as HTML.

Type this within the HTML document you just created:
MARKDOWN

    source_code "Hello World!"
    message "Save the file some place you'll be able to find easily, like your Desktop."
  end

  step do

Open Chrome and go to File, Open File, then select the file from your Desktop or wherever you put it.

<img src='img/hello_world.png'>

Even though your file does not include any HTML tags yet, browsers are <i>great</i> at showing text on screen, so your browser will just show you your text.

## HTML is Tags

In order to add special meaning to text, we need give the browser clues about how the
text should look but we have to do so in a way that makes it easy for both browsers
and people to tell the difference between content and hypertext.  HTML does this
with "tags".  An HTML tag is encased within `<`, `>`, called "angle brackets".  An
example tag is `<html>`.  Every tag has an accompanying closing tag.  Closing tags are
also encased in angle brackets but begin with a forward slash. So the closing tag that
matches our example would be `</html>`. A tag and its content create an HTML _element_.

You just coded your own matched pair of an opening and closing html tag:
MARKDOWN

source_code "HTML", "Hello <em>World</em>!"
end
