## The HTML tag and Doctype

The line `<!DOCTYPE html>` is called the doctype, and it tells the browser which flavor of HTML you're using. `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells your browser you're using HTML5, the latest version of HTML. 

(You may see older doctypes out there that are longer and a lot more complicated, from when people
used various HTML and XHTML versions, but those are annoying, and you can usually just
use this short version for new websites.)

The `<html>` encloses all the rest of your page, and states unequivocally, "Here is my HTML!!!"

## Pages, Like People, Have a Head and a Body

MARKDOWN
source_code "HTML", "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n\s\s<head>Invisible, Important Stuff</head>\n\s\s<body>Actual Visible Content</body>\n</html>"
message <<-MARKDOWN

### The Head

The head contains information _about_ the document, including:

* what language or character set you're using
* what the page title should be
* what CSS and JavaScript files to include (and where they are)

Information in the `<head>` section is __not__ displayed. 

It can also contain metadata tags that can tell a search engine or another
program more about the file, like who wrote it or what keywords are relevant.

### The Body

The Body contains the actual content of your file, the things you'll want your users
to be able to see, read, or interact with!
