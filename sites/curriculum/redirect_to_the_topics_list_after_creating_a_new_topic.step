  note <<-MARKDOWN
  * `format.html { redirect_to topics_path, :notice => 'Topic was successfully created.' }`:
    * `format.html` means that the server should send html back to the browser
    * `redirect_to topics_path` means show the **topics list page** when we're done creating a topic
    * `:notice => 'Topic was successfully created.'` puts the message into the flash so it will be displayed on the topics list
