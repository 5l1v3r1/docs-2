  note <<-MARKDOWN

  `has_many` and `belongs_to`:

  * In rails, relationships between models are called associations.
  * Associations (usually) come in pairs.
  * A topic will have many votes so we put `has_many :votes` in the
    topic model.
    * When you ask a topic for its votes, you get an array of votes
      for that topic.
  * A vote is for a particular topic, so we put `belongs_to :topic`
    in the vote model.
    * When you ask a vote for its topic, you get the topic for that
      vote.
