step "install Homebrew" do

  note <<-MARKDOWN

* The first step is to create a directory where we'll store programs used to write and run your Ruby code.  Enter these two lines below in your Terminal.  Note that the **sudo** instruction will ask for your password.  Also, make sure you change '''yourusername''' to your actual Mac OS user name.  If you don't know your username, enter the command **whoami** in your terminal and it'll output your username.

  MARKDOWN
  
  console "sudo mkdir /usr/local"
  console "sudo chown -R yourusername /usr/local"

end

step "run the Homebrew install script" do

  note <<-MARKDOWN
We've created the `/usr/local/` directory with **mkdir** for "Make Directory" and set the owner to you with **chown** (for "CHange OWNer").  This is the folder where Homebrew itself will live along with any programs we install using Homebrew.  
  MARKDOWN
  
  note "To install Homebrew in one step run this line in your Terminal:"

  console "/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)\""

  verify do
    console "brew -v"
    result "0.8"
  end
