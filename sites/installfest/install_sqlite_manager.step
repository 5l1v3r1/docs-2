* Once it's installed, open Firefox and go to Tools -> Add-ons. At the top of the add-ons window, click "Get Add-ons."

* There will be search box directly underneath "Get Add-ons" that says "Search All Add-ons." Enter `SQLite` in the box and hit enter.

* **SQLite Manager** should be the top result. Click "Add to Firefox..." 

  * If SQLite Manager isn't in the results, check the spelling - SQLite only has one L.

* Wait for the countdown, then click "Install Now."

* In the Add-ons window, click "Restart Firefox."
  * This will preserve the windows you have open, so it should bring you right back to this page.
  
* Once Firefox restarts, the Add-ons window should say "1 new add-on has been installed."
