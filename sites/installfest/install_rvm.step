note <<-MARKDOWN
RVM stands for Ruby Version Manager and is the easiest way to install and manage Ruby.  The [official RVM install instructions](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/) are available here, but this should work for you:
MARKDOWN

step "Install RVM" do
  console "bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer )"
  note "This will do some stuff and print a long message which you can ignore."
end

step "Configure your shell" do

  note "This step will assure that every time you open a new terminal window, rvm will be active inside it."

  console <<-BASH
echo '[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM function' >> ~/.bash_profile
  BASH
  console "source ~/.bash_profile"

  verify do
    console "type rvm | head -1"
    result "rvm is a function"

    console "rvm -v"
    result "rvm 1.8.6 by Wayne E. Seguin (wayneeseguin@gmail.com) [https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/]"
  end

end

step "Install Ruby 1.9.2 using RVM" do
  console "rvm install 1.9.2"

  note "This downloads and compiles Ruby, which takes a while."

  console <<-BASH
rvm use 1.9.2
rvm --default 1.9.2
  BASH

  verify do
    console "ruby -v"
    result "1.9.2"
  end
end
