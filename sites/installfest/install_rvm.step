RVM stands for Ruby Version Manager and is the easiest way to install and manage Ruby.  The [official RVM install instructions](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/) are available here, but this should work for you:
MARKDOWN

step "Install RVM" do
  console "bash -s stable < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer)"
  message "This will do some stuff and print a long message which you can ignore."
  important "Type the command exactly as shown, including a space between the two less-than signs."
  
  message "If `rvm install 1.9.3` says `autoreconf was not found in the PATH` then run

    brew install automake

and retry."
end

step "Configure your shell" do

  message "This step will assure that every time you open a new terminal window, rvm will be active inside it."

  console <<-BASH
echo '[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM function' >> ~/.bash_profile
  BASH
  todo "verify that RVM doesn't write that to your bash_profile on its own"
  
  console "source ~/.bash_profile"

  verify do
    console "type rvm | head -1"
    result "rvm is a function"

    console "rvm -v"

  end

end
