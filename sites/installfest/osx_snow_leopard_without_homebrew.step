  note <<-MARKDOWN

It's an insult in British English, but git is also an awesome version control tool. Here's how you install it:

Go to [this page on google code](http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list?can=3&q=&sort=-uploaded&colspec=Filename+Summary+Uploaded+Size+DownloadCount) and download the latest file ending in "-x86_64-leopard.dmg" (1.7.4.4 as of this writing).

**If you're at a workshop and you need this file, please ask a volunteer - we have it on a thumb drive!**

Once it's downloaded, double click to open.

Double-click the .pkg file to install. Once that's done, close all your open Terminal windows, and open a new one.

Open up a new Terminal window, and cut & paste the following, with a return after each line. Note: the first one takes a while. When it's done, it will say something similar to "Install of ruby-1.9.2-p0 - #complete." Once it's done, paste in the second line.

<pre>
rvm install 1.9.2 -C --with-readline-dir=/usr/local,--build=x86_64-apple-darwin10
rvm --create 1.9.2@global
rvm --default 1.9.2
