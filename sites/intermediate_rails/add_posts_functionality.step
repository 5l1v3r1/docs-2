* The user should be able to create a post with a name, author, date published, and content.
* The complete post should appear on its own page (aka its show page).
* The user should be able to see each post’s name, author, and date published on the overview page (aka the index page).
* The name of the post should link to the post show page.
* The index page should include a “New Post” link or button.
* If the user doesn’t submit all required fields, they should see some error messaging, but shouldn’t lose any of their work.

discussion do
message <<-MARKDOWN
* How do you create a resource? What parameters do you need to pass?
* Then: what did rails make for you when you called resource? Find all the new files. Maybe even list them out on a whiteboard.
* You’re gonna need a posts controller, a post model, and probably a couple of different views. What’s the best order to make them in?
* The command rake routes: what does it give you? How is it helpful?
* What is Active Record?

hints do
message <<-MARKDOWN
* Rails has a built-in way to note when something was stored in the database. Probably handy for showing the date / time a post was created.
