### What's a web server?

A web server listens for incoming requests from the browser and then asks to your application what it
would like to send back. This will usually be HTML in our case.

### Why run our app locally?

Running your app locally provides a very simple means to see your changes before you commit and push them to Heroku.

  important <<-MARKDOWN
On Windows, sometimes Control-C doesn't work. In that case, look for the key called 'Break' or 'Pause' and press
Control-Break, then answer Y at the prompt. If there is no Pause/Break key on your keyboard, you can run `ruby script/rails server`
instead of `rails server` which should allow Control-C to stop the server.
