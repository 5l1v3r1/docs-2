### Goal

The goal of this curriculum is to teach you how the various pieces of a Ruby on Rails
applications work together. You're going to create a voting system for you and your
friends to play with. You've decided at a minimum, you'd like to
allow users to:

* view the topics sorted by number of votes
* vote on topics
* create, edit, and destroy topics

You've sketched up an initial screenshot of what you want it to look like:

![screenshot](img/finished_app.png)

You may have built the same app before using Rails helpers like `rails generate scaffold`. None of that here! We're going to connect the models, views, and controllers together ourselves, and hopefully you'll have a better idea of how things fit together by the end of today.

### Requirements

We're going to be working with:

* ruby 1.9.3 installed via rvm (mac or linux) or RailsInstaller (mac or windows)
* rails 3.2.x or rails 4.0.x
* bundler
* sqlite
* the text editor of your choice

Everything should be set up the night before during our
installfest. Please ensure you have everything working _before_ you
show up for the workshop on Saturday.

You can verify that you have everything working by trying this out in your terminal:

<div class="console"><pre>
$ irb
>> 1 + 2
=> 3
>> require "active_support"
=> true
>> exit
$
</pre>
</div>

If you can do that, you are probably good to go.

### Working Effectively and Efficiently

We highly recommend you do the following:

* Bring up your terminal and open 2 tabs:
  * One is for regular terminal stuffs
  * One will be for irb (aka rails console). We'll explain later
* Open your browser fresh or hide any windows you already have open.
  * Bring up one window with two tabs
    * One for this content
    * One for interacting with your app.
* Open your text editor and _do not ever close it_. We're not quitters.
* Hide all extra applications. Turn off twitter, IM, and all other distractions.

By minimizing the number of things you interact with, you reduce the
amount of time spent switching between them and the context lost as
you work through the lessons. Having 50 tabs open in your web
browser gets confusing and wastes time.
