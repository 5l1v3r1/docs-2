# Thanks!

RailsBridge wouldn't be what it is without your help. Thanks for contributing.

We ask that contributions be made as pull requests via GitHub. If those words
are totally foreign to you
[see here](#its-my-first-time-on-github-ever-what-do-i-do)


# When Submitting a Pull Request

*Here's a couple tricks to grease the wheels and make it easy for the maintainers
to love you. :heart:*

## Before You Start!

- If you have an existing fork, please make sure it's up to date.
  It just makes your life easier!

- Create a local topic branch before you start working. This branch is going to
  be named for what you plan to change. `fix-typo-in-slides`, `move-resources`,
  and `mountain-lion-support` are all good names for topic branches. If you've
  never created a local branch before, you can use `git checkout -b
  new-branch-name`

## Before Submitting

- Please, please, *please* run `rake` from the terminal before you submit. It
  not only runs our test suite but also checks the docs for syntax errors.

- Push to a branch on GitHub. Just like you developed in a local branch, you
  should push to a branch of your repo on GitHub as well. The `master` branch is
  best used as a clean copy of the upstream docs repo in case you need to make
  some unrelated changes. To push to a branch, use `git push origin pr-branch`.

## Discussion and Waiting On A Merge

- Every pull request will receive a response from the team.
- Not every pull request will be merged as is.
- Not every pull request will be merged at all.
- If a pull request falls significantly behind master, we may ask that you close
it, rebase your changes off of master, and submit a new pull request.

# It's My First Time on GitHub Ever What Do I Do?

Relax, you came to the right place. In order to contribute you'll need to be
able to familiarize yourself with some concepts from git and GitHub. It's going
to be a lot of information, but you're :sparkles:awesome:sparkles:! So you it'll
be fine.

First, you'll need a GitHub account, which is totally free. You can sign up
[here](https://github.com/signup/free).

You'll want to read about
[forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and then make your own
fork of [railsbridge/docs](https://github.com/railsbridge/docs). Once you've
done so, you can clone it and get started by reading up on [what to do when
submitting a pull request](#when-submitting-a-pull-request), read up on
[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
themselves. If this is all too much, or you'd like a helping hand,
[@nuclearsandwich](https://github.com/nuclearsandwich) has volunteered to help
anyone who wants to contribute do so. His email is behind that profile link.

# Closing

If you haven't taken the time to go through the Git Immersion lab.

Do it. It's worth it no matter how much git-fu you have.

Well. I hope you're all sick of me talking, but I think I addressed
everything in the thread with respect to git, contributors, and github
to the best of my knowledge. Let me know if you think I'm wild crazy or
have a better suggestion. I'm always on the lookout.
